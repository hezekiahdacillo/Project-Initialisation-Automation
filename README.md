# Project Initialisation Automation
This is a simple python script that helps me when starting a new project. This was written using PyGithub python lib.

#### My process of creating a new project:
1. Open Terminal window and go to where I keep my projects
2. Creates folder
3. Go to the folder I just created
4. Create a README.md file
5. I initialise Git which starts a new Git repository
6. I go to github.com
7. Create new repository
8. Copy the commands for pushing an existing repository from command line
9. I push it to git
10. I open a suitable IDE of my choice (depending on what language I'm working on)
